# Browser-based Malevich
### Creative Javascript Plugins for Firefox

'Browser-based Malevich' is a triptych of Firefox browser-plugins from [internet teapot](https://www.internetteapot.com) that warp and distort 
any webpage you open into a digital approximation of one of the three thematically-related [Suprematism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprematism) paintings 
by early 20th-century avant-garde Russian artist Kazimir Malevich: Black Square (1913), Black Circle (1915), and Black Cross (1915).

[Install Black Square on Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/black-square/)
[Install Black Cross on Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/black-cross-malevich/)
[Install Black Circle on Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/black-circle-malevich/)


Browser-based Malevich is more than just a digital facsimile of a 20th century canvas-based painting, however. It takes inspiration more from the browser-based art of [Rafaël Rozendaal](https://www.newrafael.com/) in that it functions as [software art](https://monoskop.org/Software_art) (often also called artistic software, critical software, software-based art).

Each of the JavaScript plugins runs through a unique set of functions that identify a webpage’s DOM elements one by one and computationally alters their CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) properties with brute force (!important) until the whole page is a digital approximation of the pure visual abstraction corresponding to its respective Malevich painting.  

Browser-based Malevich digitally literalizes Suprematism’s non-objective cultural iconography, an iconography fit for a world in which cultural materials are increasingly mediated by abstract ones and zeros, served up to as bright shining pixels representing the world outside of our screens.

### Contribute
Given the divergent markup conventions such as semantic HTML or dynamic frameworks for DOM insertion, these plugins don’t work perfectly on all pages. 
Any suggestions or contributions to improve the plugins are welcome.
