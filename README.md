#The Box
###A Javascript browser plugin that glitches a whole website into a single square box.

Webpages are just squares upon squares upon squares computationally seperated.
Inspiration taken from [Malevich](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.abc.net.au%2Freslib%2F200707%2Fr159647_582595.jpg&f=1&nofb=1) ("the visual phenomena of the objective world are, in themselves, meaningless; the significant thing is feeling, as such, quite apart from the environment in which it is called forth") and Rafael Rozendaal's [Abstract Browsing] (https://www.newrafael.com/new-website-chrome-plugin-abstract-browsing-net/)

Feel free to contribute as I've found some sites it doesn't work that well on, and perhaps the animation can be smoother. Maybe you can make an improvement.
